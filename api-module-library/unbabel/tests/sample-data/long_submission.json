But this is by the way.\nMy chambers were up stairs at No. – Wall-street. At one end they looked\nupon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft, penetrating the\nbuilding from top to bottom. This view might have been considered rather tame\nthan otherwise, deficient in what landscape painters call “life.” But if so, the\nview from the other end of my chambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing\nmore. In that direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty\nbrick wall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no spy-glass\nto bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all near-sighted spectators,\nwas pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes. Owing to the great height\nof the surrounding buildings, and my chambers being on the second floor, the\ninterval between this wall and mine not a little resembled a huge square cistern.\nAt the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons as\ncopyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy. First, Turkey;\nsecond, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut. These may seem names, the like of which are\nnot usually found in the Directory. In truth they were nicknames, mutually con-\nferred upon each other by my three clerks, and were deemed expressive of their\nrespective persons or characters. Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman of about\nmy own age, that is, somewhere not far from sixty. In the morning, one might\nsay, his face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o’clock, meridian—his din-\nner hour—it blazed like a grate full of Christmas coals; and continued blazing—\nbut, as it were, with a gradual wane—till 6 o’clock, p.m. or thereabouts, after\nwhich I saw no more of the proprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian\nwith the sun, seemed to set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following\nday, with the like regularity and undiminished glory. There are many singular\ncoincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among which\nwas the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams from his red\nand radiant countenance, just then, too, at that critical moment, began the daily\nperiod when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed for the\nremainder of the twenty-four hours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse\nto business then; far from it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too\nenergetic. There was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of activity\nabout him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand. All\nhis blots upon my documents, were dropped there after twelve o’clock, merid-\nian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless and sadly given to making blots in the\nafternoon, but some days he went further, and was rather noisy. At such times,\ntoo, his face flamed with augmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped\non anthracite. He made an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box;\nin mending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them on the\nBartleby, The Scrivener 3\nfloor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table, boxing his papers\nabout in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold in an elderly man like\nhim. Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most valuable person to me, and all\nthe time before twelve o’clock, meridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature too,\naccomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easy to be matched—for these\nreasons, I was willing to overlook his eccentricities, though indeed, occasionally,\nI remonstrated with him. I did this very gently, however, because, though the\ncivilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of men in the morning, yet in the\nafternoon he was disposed, upon provocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue,\nin fact, insolent. Now, valuing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to\nlose them; yet, at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after\ntwelve o’clock; and being a man of peace, unwilling by my admonitions to call\nforth unseemly retorts from him; I took upon me, one Saturday noon (he was\nalways worse on Saturdays), to hint to him, very kindly, that perhaps now that\nhe was growing old, it might be well to abridge his labors; in short, he need not\ncome to my chambers after twelve o’clock, but, dinner over, had best go home to\nhis lodgings and rest himself till teatime. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon\ndevotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he oratorically assured\nme—gesticulating with a long ruler at the other end of the room—that if his ser-\nvices in the morning were useful, how indispensable, then, in the afternoon?\n“With submission, sir,” said Turkey on this occasion, “I consider myself your\nright-hand man. In the morning I but marshal and deploy my columns; but in\nthe afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly charge the foe, thus!\"—and\nhe made a violent thrust with the ruler.\n“But the blots, Turkey,” intimated I.\n“True,—but, with submission, sir, behold these hairs! I am getting old. Surely,\nsir, a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged against gray\nhairs. Old age—even if it blot the page—is honorable. With submission, sir, we\nboth are getting old.”\nThis appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted. At all events, I\nsaw that go he would not. So I made up my mind to let him stay, resolving,\nnevertheless, to see to it, that during the afternoon he had to do with my less\nimportant papers.\nNippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the whole,\nrather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I always deemed\nhim the victim of two evil powers—ambition and indigestion. The ambition was\nevinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable\nusurpation of strictly professional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal\ndocuments. The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testi-\nness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind together over\nBartleby, The Scrivener 4\nmistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions, hissed, rather than\nspoken, in the heat of business; and especially by a continual discontent with\nthe height of the table where he worked. Though of a very ingenious mechani-\ncal turn, Nippers could never get this table to suit him. He put chips under it,\nblocks of various sorts, bits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt\nan exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper. But no invention\nwould answer. If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table lid at a\nsharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a man using the steep\nroof of a Dutch house for his desk:—then he declared that it stopped the circu-\nlation in his arms. If now he lowered the table to his waistbands, and stooped\nover it in writing, then there was a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth\nof the matter was, Nippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any\nthing, it was to be rid of a scrivener’s table altogether. Among the manifestations\nof his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain\nambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his clients. Indeed I\nwas aware that not only was he, at times, considerable of a ward-politician, but he\noccasionally did a little business at the Justices’ courts, and was not unknown on\nthe steps of the Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individ-\nual who called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he insisted\nwas his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged title-deed, a bill. But with\nall his failings, and the annoyances he caused me, Nippers, like his compatriot\nTurkey, was a very useful man to me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he\nchose, was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he\nalways dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit\nupon my chambers. Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to keep\nhim from being a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily and smell\nof eating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer. His\ncoats were execrable; his hat not to be handled. But while the hat was a thing of\nindifference to me, inasmuch as his natural civility and deference, as a dependent\nEnglishman, always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his\ncoat was another matter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with\nno effect. The truth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could\nnot afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same\ntime. As Nippers once observed, Turkey’s money went chiefly for red ink. One\nwinter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable looking coat of my own,\na padded gray coat, of a most comfortable warmth, and which buttoned straight\nup from the knee to the neck. I thought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and\nabate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe\nthat buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious\neffect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses.\nBartleby, The Scrivener 5\nIn fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his oats, so Turkey felt his\ncoat. It made him insolent. He was a man whom prosperity harmed.\nThough concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey I had my own private\nsurmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that whatever might be his\nfaults in other respects, he was, at least, a temperate young man. But indeed,\nnature herself seemed to have been his vintner, and at his birth charged him so\nthoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that all subsequent pota-\ntions were needless. When I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers,\nNippers would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his\ntable, spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk it,\nwith a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a perverse vol-\nuntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly perceive that for\nNippers, brandy and water were altogether superfluous.\nIt was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar cause—indigestion— the ir-\nritability and consequent nervousness of Nippers, were mainly observable in the\nmorning, while in the afternoon he was comparatively mild. So that Turkey’s\nparoxysms only coming on about twelve o’clock, I never had to do with their ec-\ncentricities at one time. Their fits relieved each other like guards. When Nippers’\nwas on, Turkey’s was off; and vice versa. This was a good natural arrangement\nunder the circumstances.\nGinger Nut, the third on my list, was a lad some twelve years old. His father\nwas a carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of a cart, before\nhe died. So he sent him to my office as student at law, errand boy, and cleaner\nand sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a week. He had a little desk to himself, but\nhe did not use it much. Upon inspection, the drawer exhibited a great array of\nthe shells of various sorts of nuts. Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole\nnoble science of the law was contained in a nut-shell. Not the least among the\nemployments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with the most\nalacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey and Nippers. Copy-\ning law papers being proverbially dry, husky sort of business, my two scriveners\nwere fain to moisten their mouths very often with Spitzenbergs to be had at the\nnumerous stalls nigh the Custom House and Post Office. Also, they sent Ginger\nNut very frequently for that peculiar cake—small, flat, round, and very spicy—\nafter which he had been named by them. Of a cold morning when business was\nbut dull, Turkey would gobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere\nwafers—indeed they sell them at the rate of six or eight for a penny—the scrape\nof his pen blending with the crunching of the crisp particles in his mouth. Of\nall the fiery afternoon blunders and flurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once\nmoistening a ginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a\nseal. I came within an ace of dismissing him then. But he mollified me by making\nBartleby, The Scrivener 6\nan oriental bow, and saying—\"With submission, sir, it was generous of me to find\nyou in stationery on my own account.”\nNow my original business—that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-\nup of recondite documents of all sorts—was considerably increased by receiving\nthe master’s office. There was now great work for scriveners. Not only must I\npush the clerks already with me, but I must have additional help. In answer to\nmy advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my office\nthreshold, the door being open, for it was summer. I can see that figure now—\npallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.\nAfter a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to have\namong my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect, which I\nthought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey, and the\nfiery one of Nippers.\nI should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my prem-\nises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the other by\nmyself. According to my humor I threw open these doors, or closed them. I\nresolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the folding-doors, but on my side of them,\nso as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be\ndone. I placed his desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a\nwindow which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy back-yards\nand bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections, commanded at present no\nview at all, though it gave some light. Within three feet of the panes was a wall,\nand the light came down from far above, between two lofty buildings, as from\na very small opening in a dome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I\nprocured a high green folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from\nmy sight, though not remove him from my voice. And thus, in a manner, privacy\nand society were conjoined.\nAt first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long famish-\ning for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents. There\nwas no pause for digestion. He ran a day and night line, copying by sun-light and\nby candle-light. I should have been quite delighted with his application, had he\nbeen cheerfully industrious. But he wrote on silently, palely, mechanically.\nIt is, of course, an indispensable part of a scrivener’s business to verify the\naccuracy of his copy, word by word. Where there are two or more scriveners in\nan office, they assist each other in this examination, one reading from the copy,\nthe other holding the original. It is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair. I\ncan readily imagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether\nintolerable. For example, I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet Byron would\nhave contentedly sat down with Bartleby to examine a law document of, say five\nhundred pages, closely written in a crimpy hand.\nBartleby, The Scrivener 7\nNow and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist in com-\nparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for this purpose.\nOne object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me behind the screen, was to\navail myself of his services on such trivial occasions. It was on the third day, I\nthink, of his being with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his\nown writing examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had\nin hand, I abruptly called to Bartleby. In my haste and natural expectancy of\ninstant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my desk, and\nmy right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with the copy, so\nthat immediately upon emerging from his retreat, Bartleby might snatch it and\nproceed to business without the least delay.\nIn this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating what it\nwas I wanted him to do—namely, to examine a small paper with me. Imagine\nmy surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his privacy,\nBartleby in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, “I would prefer not to.”\nI sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties. Immediately it\noccurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Bartleby had entirely misunder-\nstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could assume. But\nin quite as clear a one came the previous reply, “I would prefer not to.”\n“Prefer not to,” echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the room\nwith a stride. “What do you mean? Are you moon-struck? I want you to help\nme compare this sheet here—take it,” and I thrust it towards him.\n“I would prefer not to,” said he.\nI looked at him steadfastly. His face was leanly composed; his gray eye dimly\ncalm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him. Had there been the least uneasi-\nness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in other words, had there\nbeen any thing ordinarily human about him, doubtless I should have violently\ndismissed him from the premises. But as it was, I should have as soon thought\nof turning my pale plaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors. I stood gazing at\nhim awhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at my\ndesk. This is very strange, thought I. What had one best do? But my business\nhurried me. I concluded to forget the matter for the present, reserving it for my\nfuture leisure. So calling Nippers from the other room, the paper was speedily\nexamined.\nA few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being\nquadruplicates of a week’s testimony taken before me in my High Court of\nChancery. It became necessary to examine them. It was an important suit, and\ngreat accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I called Turkey, Nip-\npers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to place the four copies in\nthe hands of my four clerks, while I should read from the original. Accordingly\nBartleby, The Scrivener 8\nTurkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut had taken their seats in a row, each with his\ndocument in hand, when I called to Bartleby to join this interesting group.\n“Bartleby! quick, I am waiting.”\nI heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and soon he\nappeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.\n“What is wanted?” said he mildly.\n“The copies, the copies,” said I hurriedly. “We are going to examine them.\nThere\"—and I held towards him the fourth quadruplicate.\n“I would prefer not to,” he said, and gently disappeared behind the screen.\nFor a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the head of\nmy seated column of clerks. Recovering myself, I advanced towards the screen,\nand demanded the reason for such extraordinary conduct.\n“Why do you refuse?”\n“I would prefer not to.”\nWith any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion,\nscorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence. But\nthere was something about Bartleby that not only strangely disarmed me, but in\na wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me. I began to reason with him.\n“These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving to\nyou, because one examination will answer for your four papers. It is common\nusage. Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy. Is it not so? Will you\nnot speak? Answer!”\n“I prefer not to,” he replied in a flute-like tone. It seemed to me that while I\nhad been addressing him, he carefully revolved every statement that I made; fully\ncomprehended the meaning; could not gainsay the irresistible conclusions; but,\nat the same time, some paramount consideration prevailed with him to reply as\nhe did.\n“You are decided, then, not to comply with my request—a request made ac-\ncording to common usage and common sense?”\nHe briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was sound.\nYes: his decision was irreversible.\nIt is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some unprece-\ndented and violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in his own plainest\nfaith. He begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that, wonderful as it may be, all\nthe justice and all the reason is on the other side. Accordingly, if any disinter-\nested persons are present, he turns to them for some reinforcement for his own\nfaltering mind.\n“Turkey,” said I, “what do you think of this? Am I not right?”\n“With submission, sir,” said Turkey, with his blandest tone, “I think that you\nare.”\nBartleby, The Scrivener 9\n“Nippers,” said I, “what do you think of it?”\n“I think I should kick him out of the office.”\n(The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that, it being morning,\nTurkey’s answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but Nippers replies in\nill-tempered ones. Or, to repeat a previous sentence, Nippers’ ugly mood was on\nduty and Turkey’s off.)\n“Ginger Nut,” said I, willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my behalf,\n“what do you think of it?”\n“I think, sir, he’s a little luny,” replied Ginger Nut with a grin.\n“You hear what they say,” said I, turning towards the screen, “come forth and\ndo your duty.”\nBut he vouchsafed no reply. I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But\nonce more business hurried me. I determined again to postpone the considera-\ntion of this dilemma to my future leisure. With a little trouble we made out to\nexamine the papers without Bartleby, though at every page or two, Turkey defer-\nentially dropped his opinion that this proceeding was quite out of the common;\nwhile Nippers, twitching in his chair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out\nbetween his set teeth occasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf be-\nhind the screen. And for his (Nippers’) part, this was the first and the last time\nhe would do another man’s business without pay.\nMeanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but his\nown peculiar business there.\nSome days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work.\nHis late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I observed\nthat he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any where. As yet I had\nnever of my personal knowledge known him to be outside of my office. He was a\nperpetual sentry in the corner. At about eleven o’clock though, in the morning, I\nnoticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward the opening in Bartleby’s screen,\nas if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat. The boy\nwould then leave the office jingling a few pence, and reappear with a handful of\nginger-nuts which he delivered in the hermitage, receiving two of the cakes for\nhis trouble.\nHe lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly speak-\ning; he must be a vegetarian then; but no; he never eats even vegetables, he eats\nnothing but ginger-nuts. My mind then ran on in reveries concerning the proba-\nble effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts. Ginger-\nnuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents,\nand the final flavoring one. Now what was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was\nBartleby hot and spicy? Not at all. Ginger, then, had no effect upon Bartleby.\nProbably he preferred it should have none.\nBartleby, The Scrivener 10\nNothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance. If the indi-\nvidual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting one perfectly\nharmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of the former, he will en-\ndeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves impossible to be\nsolved by his judgment. Even so, for the most part, I regarded Bartleby and his\nways. Poor fellow! thought I, he means no mischief; it is plain he intends no\ninsolence; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary.\nHe is useful to me. I can get along with him. If I turn him away, the chances\nare he will fall in with some less indulgent employer, and then he will be rudely\ntreated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve. Yes. Here I can cheaply\npurchase a delicious self-approval. To befriend Bartleby; to humor him in his\nstrange willfulness, will cost me little or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what\nwill eventually prove a sweet morsel for my conscience. But this mood was not\ninvariable with me. The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me. I felt\nstrangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some angry\nspark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well have essayed\nto strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap. But one afternoon\nthe evil impulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued:\n“Bartleby,” said I, “when those papers are all copied, I will compare them\nwith you.”\n“I would prefer not to.”\n“How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?”\nNo answer.\nI threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and Nip-\npers, exclaimed in an excited manner—\n“He says, a second time, he won’t examine his papers. What do you think of\nit, Turkey?”\nIt was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass boiler,\nhis bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted papers.\n“Think of it?” roared Turkey; “I think I’ll just step behind his screen, and\nblack his eyes for him!”\nSo saying, Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic position.\nHe was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I detained him, alarmed\nat the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey’s combativeness after dinner.\n“Sit down, Turkey,” said I, “and hear what Nippers has to say. What do\nyou think of it, Nippers? Would I not be justified in immediately dismissing\nBartleby?”\n“Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir. I think his conduct quite unusual,\nand indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself. But it may only be a passing\nwhim.”\nBartleby, The Scrivener 11\n“Ah,” exclaimed I, “you have strangely changed your mind then—you speak\nvery gently of him now.”\n“All beer,” cried Turkey; “gentleness is effects of beer—Nippers and I dined\ntogether to-day. You see how gentle I am, sir. Shall I go and black his eyes?”\n“You refer to Bartleby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Turkey,” I replied; “pray,\nput up your fists.”\nI closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby. I felt additional\nincentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled against again. I re-\nmembered that Bartleby never left the office.\n“Bartleby,” said I, “Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post Office,\nwon’t you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there is any thing for me.”\n“I would prefer not to.”\n“You will not?”\n“I prefer not.”\nI staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy\nreturned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be igno-\nminiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?—my hired clerk? What added\nthing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do?\n“Bartleby!”\nNo answer.\n“Bartleby,” in a louder tone.\nNo answer.\n“Bartleby,” I roared.\nLike a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third\nsummons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.\n“Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.”\n“I prefer not to,” he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared.\n“Very good, Bartleby,” said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe self-possessed\ntone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible retribution very close\nat hand. At the moment I half intended something of the kind. But upon the\nwhole, as it was drawing towards my dinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my\nhat and walk home for the day, suffering much from perplexity and distress of\nmind.\nShall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this whole business was, that it\nsoon became a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener, by the name\nof Bartleby, had a desk there; that he copied for me at the usual rate of four cents\na folio (one hundred words); but he was permanently exempt from examining\nthe work done by him, that duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers, one\nof compliment doubtless to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was\nnever on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort; and\n",

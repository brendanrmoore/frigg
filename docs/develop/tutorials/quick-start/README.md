# Quick Start Tutorial

### Getting Started

Aloha! Letâ€™s test out running Frigg locally by cloning and installing a quick start template app.&#x20;

### Prerequisites

* Make sure you have [node and npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### Overview

There are two libraries we will be working with from npm: [create-frigg-app](https://github.com/friggframework/create-frigg-app) and [frigg](https://github.com/friggframework/frigg)

Create-Frigg-App will generate a Frigg application that within a few minutes is deployable to your own infrastructure accounts. Let's get Create-Frigg-App going and unpack the "magic" as we go.

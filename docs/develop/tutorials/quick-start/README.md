# Quick Start Tutorial

### Getting Started

Aloha! Letâ€™s test out running Frigg locally by cloning and installing a quick start template app.&#x20;

### Prerequisites

* Make sure you have [node and npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* Create a free hosted MongoDB cluster through [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) OR [install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) locally
  * You'll need to create a db admin user and you'll want your connection string.
  * More information on how to do this can be found in [here](connecting-to-the-database.md).

### Overview

There are two libraries we will be working with from npm: [create-frigg-app](https://github.com/friggframework/create-frigg-app) and [frigg](https://github.com/friggframework/frigg)

Create-Frigg-App will generate a Frigg application that within a few minutes is deployable to your own infrastructure accounts. Let's get Create-Frigg-App going and unpack the "magic" as we go.

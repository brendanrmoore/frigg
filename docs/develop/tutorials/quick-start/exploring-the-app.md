# Exploring the Frontend



## **Frontend Overview**

The frontend is totally optional. The benefit of this front end is to allow easy application configuration and authorization. However, you can simply use the backend to integrate frigg into your existing application.

The frontend is a cookie cutter React application built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/). It also leverages the Frigg React component library for the Integration Management page. This is the core piece to pay attention to for your own application. You can read more about Frontend options and concepts with [Frigg here.](../../../reference/architecture.md)

We provide a very lightweight/basic user login flow and dashboard. Go ahead and try logging in or creating an account.

Once you log in successfully, you will see a page that shows all installed integrations.

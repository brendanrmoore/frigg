# Overview

API Modules are the Lego bricks that make Frigg-powered integrations develop faster. An API Module is the code that wraps your target partner's API and represents that API back to Frigg.

Frigg's library of API Modules is available for free. Translation: if your target partner's logo is in this library already, Frigg just saved your developers many hours of work, becuse these API Modules are plug n' play.

See the[ full library](https://friggframework.partnerpage.io/api-modules) with categories and filtering.

<summary>Frigg Explained to Partnership Leaders &#x26; Non-Technical People</summary>

The Frigg Integration Framework is a software development tool intended to help engineers build integrations faster.

While we all know that new "tech partnerships" unlock business opportunities, integration development is a complex, product-driven process performed by engineers and designers. Partnership leaders can't conjure new integrations into existence; product & engineering resources must be engaged and supported.

Given these dynamics, partnership leaders often seek _external_ vendors and tools to get integrations built. This search brings them to Frigg and [Left Hook](https://lefthook.com).

Before you introduce Frigg to your engineering colleagues, partnership leaders should understand Frigg at a non-technical level. Our [Non-Technical Overview Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRzCTIUhUj5NC5CKIOhn36NGu6TbUPMwMF5-hFLJ2fuhfrCJ2VXnabtxqE429iP1CxPPgPyhzez41jk/pub) is intended to provide this context and support your internal advocacy for Frigg.

Meanwhile, Frigg's documentation site is targeted at engineers and product leaders who will need to understand the framework as a development tool.&#x20;

If you're ready to introduce Frigg to your technical colleagues, share this documentation site. Our [live demo site](https://demo.friggframework.,org) is also instructive to both technical and non-technical audiences as well.

* Goddess of **marriage** and **partnerships**
* She flies the earthly skies as a falcon
* She is known in folklore as the **‚Äúweaver of clouds‚Äù**

The Frigg Integration Framework powers integrations between software companies, the majority of which are in the cloud, speeding up time to live on tech partnerships.

## The Problem Frigg Solves

As developers, we are constantly asked to add an integration to a software product. This means going to a third party service like google maps or salesforce and integrating those features into your business application.&#x20;

This can be very time consuming and we are all doing the same thing. We made Frigg to provide a way for developers to collaborate on this problem with an open source library that attempts to handle third party integrations in a simple and repeatable way.

**TLDR**; have all developers work on the same generic 3rd party integrations and interact with those integrations in a similar way.&#x20;

**Benefits**: Faster time to market, a community of developers on the same problem, less headaches and doc reading!&#x20;

## How Does Frigg Work?&#x20;

Frigg is built on a scalable serverless.com architecture (You can learn more about serverless [here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs))  with a growing library of prebuilt API Modules that you can use out of the box. The core features include authentication and configuration of these 3rd party services.

Along with the core features, Frigg contains flexible modules that can adapt to your company's use cases in the event that you need to work with an API in a custom way.

A Frigg Application is predominantly a backend service, with an optional frontend for configuration.

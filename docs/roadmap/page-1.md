We've got a dedicated roadmap tool to help you track specifics, and to let you make suggestions. Wherever you're comfortable, since it's integrated to GitHub.

At a very high level, however, here's what we want to accomplish in the near, mid, and long terms:

### Near Term Roadmap

This is in the next 3-6 months, heading into 2023.

* Rapidly add more API Modules
* Add unit tests to all core modules to harden them up for future iteration
* Simplify the install process
* Add more documentation
* Add notes for deploying using popular services

### Mid Term Roadmap

In the next 6-12 months, through 2023

* Add support for major databases
  * Postgres
  * Redis
  * MySQL ?
  * DynamoDB
* Add support for all major cloud providers
  * Google Cloud
  * Microsoft Azure
* Add CLI for rapidly adding integrations
* Add robust versioning system
* Analytics and Management API and corresponding code

### Long Term Roadmap

Sometime in the future, end state goal

* Make Frigg easily deployable with docker/kubernetes if desired
* Support multiple languages for runtime
* Optimize the primitives so Frigg is the fastest possible service
